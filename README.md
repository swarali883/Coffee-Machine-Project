# Coffee-Machine-Project
Inspired by the real life coffee machine. Made 3 hot flavours - Expresso, Latte &amp; Cappuccino. 
Each requires different quantity of water, milk and coffee with different price. Modelled all this data in the coffee machine. 

All this data is stoed in a dictionary. Coffee machine has some resources to start on (300 ml water, 200ml milk and 100g coffee). The second features is that, it is operated with coins (penny, dime, nickel & quarter).  
Program Requirements:
1. Print report (what resources are left)
2. Check resources are sufficient? (when the user orders a drink)
3. Process coins
4. Check transaction successful? 
5. Make coffee
